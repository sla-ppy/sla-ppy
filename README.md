### I have a deep passion for programming, that I wish to share with others.

>* Soon to be ready for pushing my first portfolio onto a VPS, and deploying it online!
>* Learning ncurses to make a dungeon crawling style project, written in 'C++' of course.
>* Waiting to get started on a gardening application with some new friends. *zZz*
>* Rewriting my CV with a new sense of effort.

#### If you have any questions, or you'd like to receive help from someone, maybe you are just starting out:
I'll make time for you.
<br>Dont be a stranger.

#### You'd like me to collaborate on your project?
My vigilance for fun, new projects never falters.
<br>I'll gladly contribute to anything that is satisfying to work on!
