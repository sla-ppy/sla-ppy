## About:
Hi!
My name is Mikl√≥s, and I an undergrad of NJE-GAMF.
Working towards becoming a Junior Software Developer / Junior Embedded Engineer / Junior Electrical Engineer

## Field of Study: Computer Science Engineering
It is planned that I would either get an MSc in Computer Science Engineering or Electrical Engineering.
I would also like to push myself to earn a PhD.

## Interests:
My firm belief is that studying outside of university is what got me here today, as most of what I know is either self-taught or has been taught to me by others through my own effort on asking them the right questions, and naturally them being kind by patiently explaining it to me.

These are my interests within the field:
- Analog Electronics, Soldering, PCB design, Electronics Theory
- Amateur Radio
- 3D Printing, 3D Modelling
- Programming, Rust, C/C++
- Low-Level Engineering, Digital Electronics, Computer Architecture.
- Mathematics, Physics for applied sciences

Interests outside of the field:
- Welding, Carpentry / Woodworking
- Cooking
- Proper excercise, Yoga, Weightlifting, Cardio and Running
