## About:

Szervusz, this is sla-ppy's domain!

I am an undergrad student at NJE-GAMF, which is where I put most of my attention and effort to.
I'd like to achieve an MSc in Electrical Engineering.

Field of Study: Computer Science Engineering.
Specialization: Electronics, Industrial Informatics

Firm believer of studying outside of university as most of what I know today is self-taught or has been taught to me by others through my own spent effort on asking them the right questions, and of course them being kind and friendly by explaining it to me.

My current interests are composed of:
- Becoming a radio amateur!
- Analog Electronics, Soldering, 3D Printing, PCB design, every tid-bit skill that comes with the lifestyle! 
- C/C++ programming
- Low-level engineering, Digital Electronics, Computer Architecture.
- Mathematics and Physics, out of which are both fundamentals to make all of my above interests come true.
- Welding, engineering, carpentry work for creating the frame of every other electronics project.

## On-going projects:
- Building a campfire sound effect circuit, which I want to encase in a 3D printed frame, along with a LED matrix or some similar display which animates the fire based on the sound frequencies the circuit works by.
- Dogscillator: Our dog went deaf, so I am planning a RX/TX device which vibrates on the collar of his along with its remote.
- sla-ppy.com: I am working on my site which hopefully will be able to show more people to start living their childhood dreams and help them with the information I've acquired over the years.
