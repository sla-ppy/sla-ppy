I have a deep passion for programming, that I wish to share with others.

* Soon to be ready for pushing my first portfolio onto a VPS, and deploying it online!
* Learning ncurses to make a dungeon crawling style project, written in C++ of course.
* Waiting to get started on a gardening application with some new friends. *zZz*
* Rewriting my CV with a new sense of effort.

Dont be a stranger.
