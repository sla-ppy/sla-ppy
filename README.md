## Belief:
Be patient\
Its about the journey

Become aware, study, implement\
Being self-taught is non-negotiable

Its okay to fail\
Error, acknowledge, accept, implement change, learn from it

Its okay to ask for help\
There is no place for ego\
Ask excellently\
You don't have to know everything

Do not take all advice

If all seems unreachable\
Take a break\
But return, due time\
For it is within your grasp
