## About:
Hi!
My name is Mikl√≥s, and I finished my studies in BSc Computer Science Engineering.\
I am Junior level Software Developer.\
Currently entering the job market.

## Field of Study: Computer Science Engineering
I will pursue further studies in either MSc Computer Science Engineering or MSc Electrical Engineering.\
Afterwards I'll earn my PhD.

## Interests:
My firm belief is that studying outside of university is what got me here today, as most of what I know is either self-taught or has been taught to me by others through joined effort on asking them the right questions, and naturally them being kind by patiently explaining it to me.

These are my interests within the field:
- Analog electronics, soldering, PCB design, electrotechnics
- Amateur radio
- 3D printing, 3D modelling
- Programming, Rust, C/C++
- Low-level engineering, digital electronics, computer architecture
- Mathematics, physics for applied sciences

Interests outside of the field:
- Welding, carpentry / woodworking
- Cooking
- Proper excercise, yoga, weightlifting, cardio and running
