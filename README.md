I have a deep passion for programming, that I wish to share with others.

* Learning ncurses to make a dungeon crawling style project, written in C++ of course.
* Getting started on a gardening application with some new friends.
* Looking for a way to be able to make a portfolio, which is straightforward enough, but doesn't hurt your eyes when you take a glance at it.
* Rewriting my CV.

Dont be a stranger.
