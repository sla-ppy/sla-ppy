## My very first portfolio is actually live, but work will continue steadily until its in a presentable state!
#### This wouldn't exist right now without the help of lionkor. 
#### I appreciate having the best mentor I could ever ask for.
<br>

### I have a deep passion for programming, that I wish to share with others.

>* Falling in love with working on networks, thinking about when to work on creating my own SSL certificate.
>* Learning ncurses to make a dungeon crawling style project, written in 'C++' of course.
>* Rewriting my CV with a new sense of effort.

#### If you have any questions, or you'd like to receive help from someone, maybe you are just starting out:
I'll make time for you.
<br>Dont be a stranger.
<br>

#### You'd like me to collaborate on your project?
My vigilance for fun, new projects never falters.
<br>I'll gladly contribute to anything which is satisfying to work on!
